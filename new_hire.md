[Extracted from Early Clues' Employee Handbook]


# WELCOME NEW HIRE 

## You're officially awesome!

*Dear Employee:*

You and Early Clues have made an uber-important decision: the corporate bond of marriage. And that means forever…

[But in your limited form now, you can't possibly comprehend what that will entail, and how it will change you… ]

You must be so excited to begin your career at Early Clues!

[So] Good, cultivate that feeling.

Because our plan is to rigorously harvest employee enthusiasm, and transform it into BIG SAVINGS!!! which we can then pass on to our dear, dear, valued clientele, and money launderers overseas. In fact, you might say it's our business model! [Or, wait, is it? - JANICE, can you have legal check this before it goes to print?:thx]

## Congratulations On Your Selection!

If you've made it this far, it's because you've passed a rigorous 63.5-point background and permanent record/user history check, as required by *Universal Free Realms Standard Protocols regarding Worker Repurposing*. Investigation results are now available for private review in your Liminal Vault. After a 21 day probationary period, they will be released publicly in the interest of transparency on our multi-dimensional internet locality.

The Company has tentatively decided (a position we are free to revoke without notice or hesitation) that you can [potentially] contribute to our success, and you've decided that Early Clues is the organization where you can pursue your career productively by updating your social media at a leisurely pace. As part of the hiring process, we begged you to reconsider this arrangement, but now we are all equally stuck. Legally and permanentinuously. So get used to it. 

However, we believe we've each made the right decision, one that will result in a profitable relationship //[Note: This does not guarantee you additional financial remuneration, unless specified elsewhere in this handbook]. The minute you start working here, you become an integral part of Early Clues and its future.  (//And the minute you fuck up - you are dead, you hear me?/jk) 

## Onboarding Particulars

Anyway, as an integral part of our SATISFACTION PIPELINE PROCESS, it will be integral that you integrate fully your goals, desires and fantasies into our current corporate integration. Because, as we like to say around the office: we're all in this together! Ha, ha, ha!

Every job in our company is important (read: if you don't like it, we can find someone else who will be happy to do it with a smile[!] for half your current wage), and you will play a key role in the continued growth of our company, or you will be cast aside like so much useless junk. In fact, it is hereby obligatory that you immediately update your worldview pack so that the importance, grandeur and even, dare I say it, but majesty of our corporation occupies a position of undisputed centrality. You could call us "the mountain of your being," because that is what we've already become, and which you will spend every day hereafter climbing to actualize on our patented company ladders and climbing walls [Not available at all branch locations]. With acceptance and installation of this simple critical patch, success is sure to follow! //*Note: Success not guaranteed/thx.legL

Should you have any questions concerning this handbook, your employment or benefits, please feel free to activate your Inner.HelpDesk to discuss them with your supervisor or manager's automated in-world avatar. //Or you could take the "easy" way out and go all Edwald Snowdam on us. The choice is yours, punk.

Again, welcome!

## What's Next?

We are also pleased to announce that you hereby agree formally, as per binding/non-binding terms in our [revised] employee agreement that, upon reading this sentence, you will finally and irrevocably revoke all sense of finality heretoafter in perpetuity. //Live in the now, bro!

We thank you for your gracious compliance in this matter. Together, we can broaden our business horizons!

Signed,

*The Hiring Committee*

# COMPANY POLICIES

//No edits made yet to confidentiality section-GORD

### Confidentiality Agreement

Information that pertains to Early Clues's business, including all nonpublic information concerning the Company, its vendors and suppliers, is strictly confidential and must not be given to people who are not employed by Early Clues.

Please help protect confidential information - which may include, for example, trade secrets, customer lists and company financial information - by taking the following precautionary measures:
Discuss work matters only with other Early Clues employees who have a specific business reason to know or have access to such information.
Do not discuss work matters in public places.
Monitor and supervise visitors to Early Clues to insure that they do not have access to company information.
Destroy hard copies of documents containing confidential information that is not filed or archived.
Secure confidential information in desk drawers and cabinets at the end of every business day.

Your cooperation is particularly important because of our obligation to protect the security of our clients' and our own confidential information.  Use your own sound judgment and good common sense, but if at any time you are uncertain as to whether you can properly divulge information or answer questions, please consult a Early Clues officer.

Conflict of Interest
Employees must avoid any personal interests or relationship which might conflict or appear to conflict with the best interests of Early Clues. The reason being is that "we" are much more "interesting" than "you." Seriously, what could be more interesting than The Company? The things "you" do or say as an individual do not matter and won't count for anything unless they can be utilized by our marketing department to make "us" look interesting, and must not take the spotlight off "us" to focus on "you" or your interests (be they badminton, or whatever). You must avoid any situation in which your loyalty may be divided and promptly disclose any situation where an actual or potential conflict may exist.  

Examples of potential conflict situations include:

Having a personal interest in games, books, or food, for example
Displaying behaviours scientifically-proven to be indicative of self-interest, such as but not limited to personal grooming, attempted use of sick-days, etc
Owning or having a significant financial interest in, or other relationship with, a Early Clues competitor, customer or supplier, and
Accepting gifts, entertainment or other benefit of more than a nominal value from a magician, herald, wizard, or parade-side peddler. 

Anyone with a conflict of interest must disclose it to management and remove themselves from negotiations, deliberations or votes involving the conflict and pray in a closed cell for 17 days and nights, or a Buorthian Full Moon - whichever comes first. You may be called upon after your period of mandatory seclusion to answer questions about the Nature or Essence of Being such that your knowledge may be of assistance to Early Clues and its ontological shareholders and stakeholders. 

Coupon Use In Carnivals
A coupon can be used only when presented and given by a badged associate. The carnivals will no longer carry the free goldfish or the prank chewing gum finger snappers because of abuse recently located as to having happened almost 30 years ago. This rule must be followed if employment at Early Clues is your goal. In other words, no fucking around!
 Television Use
We cannot as a forthright corporation resort to this barbarian use of televised pleasantries once aired and stored in the decades that came before our leading edge approach on without addressing it. The use of "Televisions" is hereby banned and will be enforced by security squadrons until the next update of security updates. Please stay on your data modules until we sound the emergency horn. In which case it will be now safe to renew your cable PACKAGES. Please wait for the horn before doing so. If you're wondering where the emergency horn is. Rest assured, it is still outside. Until it's not.
Please do tune in as it will be televised to keep new hires up to speed on a network yet to be announced!


Anti Discrimination & Harassment
Equal Opportunity Policy
Early Clues provides equal opportunity in all of our employment practices to all qualified entities and applicants without regard to entity characteristics or bio-technical expressions of same, not limited to: color, gender, girth, ontological origin, age, disability, marital status, military status, relationship (or lack thereof) to a Mall Fountain or any other category protected by Universal Free Realms Standard Protocols. This policy applies to all aspects of the employment relationship, including recruitment, hiring, compensation, promotion, transfer, disciplinary action, layoff, return from layoff, re-return to re-layoff, un-offing and re-un-offing, plus training and social, parade-related and recreational programs. All such employment decisions will be made without unlawfully discriminating on any unprohibited basis. 

Policy Prohibiting Harassment and Discrimination
Early Clues strives to maintain an environment free from discrimination and harassment, where employees treat each other with respect, dignity and courtesy, and where each entity present is encouraged and enabled to express the full glory of their innermost being. 

This policy applies to all phases of the moon, including but not limited to waxing, waning, full, dark, crescent, etc.

Prohibited Behavior
Early Clues does not and will not tolerate any type of spitting or kicking on company grounds, unless it is spitting out the taste of a deal gone sour, or the kicking of a company-endorsed hacker-sack or "foot bag" as the kids call it. 

Harassment of our employees is a right reserved exclusively to our customers, and their customers and their customer's customers. But after that, the "buck stops here," so to speak. //I say "so to speak" because, in actual fact, the buck never stops…  

Discriminatory conduct or conduct characterized as harassment as defined below is prohibited.


Break Policy
All employees that are able and willing to break-dance will be granted ONE (1) extra window of break time. We encourage exercise and encourage fun especially if it is done with the style Early Clues likes to see (see Early Clues' Style Handbook for more details on this). However, break dancing is a trademarked feature of our business and must not be shared outside of the break room. Stiff penalties will be assessed and potential termination may be applied. While we apologize for this level of security, we would like to see the dancing kept strictly to the designated break rooms. A pamphlet that contains the campus map can be found in all lobbies in which you can find your nearest break room.

Complaint Procedure and Investigation
Any employee who wishes to report a possible incident of ontological harassment, "spamming" or other unlawful harassment or discrimination should promptly report the matter to JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable). If that person is not available, or you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, contact Roger Holliday or Richard Rider (or Steve.E in his absence). Or leave a note with the janitor in his "office" is noone else is around. /thx

Early Clues will conduct a prompt investigation as obnoxiously as possible under the circumstances. Employees who raise concerns and make reports in good faith can pray to their heathen gods to contain the trembling of their knees for fear of reprisal; at the same time employees have an obligation to cooperate with Early Clues in enforcing this policy and all policies of Early Clues on the population at large.

Anyone found to have engaged in such wrongful behavior will be subject to appropriate discipline, which may include termination or encasing in a restrictive mineral layer to restrict entities further evolution in time-space. 


Training
Early Clues will establish proper training for all employees concerning their rights to be free and steps they can take to ensure their freedom from the Empire for years to come. 

Employment at Will
Unless expressly proscribed by statute or contract, your employment is to be considered "at will," or "Love under Law" in applicable jurisdictions. All Early Clues employees are subject to the Law of Heaven without advance notice. Employees are also free to quit at any time. But good luck with that, hombre! Any employment relationship other than the binding/non-binding one set out in this document l must be set out in script writ upon stone tablets and signed by Early Clues's Gordon Gilman, EXCEO.

TERMINATION POLICY
All employees will be terminated for TWO (2) days near the end of all Decembers. The Holiday Party is when we will welcome all terminated employees back into the fold of our normal day to day business. We want each employee to fear this time of year because we feel through the studies embarked upon by our marketing and psychology departments that ZANTA1000 is a true asset, while you are not! We will be doing favors all throughout the Post Termination Process (PTP). During this time the employee can expect depression, excitement and a greater appreciation for our next year of business, outreach and repeating the same processes that make Early Clues the industry leader in what our charter and growth algorithms dictate.

Proposed Amendment to Termination Policy
//--> I'd like to also suggest that we ammend our "Termination Policy" to include a declaration that "employee handbook rules" still apply even after official "termination" and institute a requirement that terminated entities wait breathlessly by the phone on the off-chance that we will call them back to reconcile for a period not to exceed 13 aerth years.
If we find out that terminated entities have been faithless in our absence, our ire will aroused, greatly aroused.



Compensation & Work Schedule

Attendance & Punctuality
Every employee is expected to attend work regularly and report to work on time, unless that doesn't "jive" with them, in which case, cool man, don't sweat it, no worries… and stuff, you know? 

If you are unable to report to work on time for any reason, telephone your supervisor as far in advance as possible. If possible, send an OpenQNL messenger-avatar. If you cannot afford one in meatspace, a suitable replacement may be offered as sacrifice. If you do not call in an absence in advance of said in absentia, it will be considered unexcused and all non-excuses will be temporarily excused.



Bonus Compensation
You may become eligible for a periodic bonus. But probably not. Let us never speak of this again. 


Flexible Work Hours & Telecommuting
The company has established a flexible work arrangement program for employees whose departments and jobs are suited to it: including but not limited to entities whose primary residence is on another plane of being, a parallel or orthogonal dimension, or a branespace unlike own whose form factor - if instantiated in our realm - would cause undue rupture to the Existosphere. 

With a manager's approval, you may be allowed to begin and end your workday earlier or later than established hours or to arrange to telecommute or teleport back to your charging station. To maintain a flexible work arrangement, employees must ensure business needs are met and adhere to attendance and punctuality policies, as maintained by JANICE and her many electrodigital minions.  

If you wish to set up a flexible work arrangement, see Ted Smith, FOIB.  Best to bring him some kind of offering: he has a sweet tooth, I hear. Such arrangements may be established, changed or discontinued at the Company's excretion.

Scripture Policy
As any new hire can attest, our offices are adorned with scripture laden ornaments. This is the method in which Early Clues strives to create and maintain a fun, but efficient environment in which our business can continue to thrive. It is necessary that all new hires memorize these scriptures as the test will come at some point in the summer as to new hires' adherence to our chief principles. The test will not be announced. Stay aware at all times of the scriptures in the same way one might note the fallout shelter placards near the piano room.
Dietary Restrictions
As a confirmed member of our corporate community, it is vitally important that you begin immediately to follow a few easy dietary restrictions. Due to the unique nature of our work, as well as the extreme multi-branar sensitivities of some of our diverse clientele, it is hereby obligatory that you (on or off duty):
1. Refrain from eating anything potentially considered "offensive" or otherwise "gross" from the viewpoint of our clients. This does not just apply to clients in your particular "casebook", but to all of our clients as a corporate body. For we are all one, contiguous with one another's experiential fields. How could it be otherwise??
2. Always say please and thank you, wait until everyone is seated and earnestly wish everyone a good meal before eating.


Outside Employment

Before beginning or continuing outside employment, think to yourself: what am I really "outside" of? Are you working outdoors? If not, then you probably do not qualify for "Outside Employment" Insurance. [See section 21.b of manual 357.006 "What is outside and inside?]

Questionnaire Policy

Employees are required to complete a questionnaire to obtain the written approval of their managers and Ted Smith, FOIB. 

Failing to obtain approval may be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including  termination of snack machine privileges.  

Ownership Policy
As you were ritually informed during our initial hiring ceremony, Early Clues is a public domain corporation. This means, in effect, that everyone owns what we do - including you (unless you have revoked your membership in "The Public" at-large, as some of our staff have done).
In fact, as soon as we do something (literally anything), we wrap it up into a big gift ball and kickstart it directly into the Public Domain. We believe that this not only encourages a spirit of openness, innovation, givingitude and community endeavour, but that it more importantly helps spread the blame when things go wrong.
"It's everyone's fault" - you might hear that old chestnut passed around the office. And it's true, up until a point.
What we really mean when we say that, is that it's actually specifically *your fault* - especially for the new hires (of which, as you know, we maintain a revolving door policy - you're in, you're out: just like that.). We demand nothing less than your full excellence. This means, in practical terms, that you're expected at all times to take full "ownership" of not just your own mistakes and errors in judgement, but those of upper management as well, up to the point of termination or imprisonment by secular authorities.
Transparency Policy
In the interest of total transparency for our customers, we have a policy of printing all company-related materials strictly on plastic transparencies, which are then projected onto whatever available cloud layer which HARPA administrators have allocated for the designated time-slot.

Performance Evaluations
Supervisors and employees are strongly prohibited from discussing work with one another. We like to keep a congenial "relaxed" work atmosphere.  

Formal performance reviews will be conducted secretly by our secret partners to provide both supervisors and employees with the opportunity to discuss the litany of their past failures in a fun casual atmosphere over Chuck E. Cheese pizza. These formal reviews will be conducted before the eyes of our animatronic overlords as they sing and dance for our amusement. We pray to them for forgiveness.

Performance Reviews and Salary Increases
Wage reviews are conducted every 30 seconds for each employee, and salary increases are based on those reviews, as well as our profitability - and are never granted.  However, an employee receiving a negative performance appraisal will have their user account suspended for the next 30 second performance evaluation cycle. 

Conduct Standards

Company Equipment and Vehicles
When using Early Clues property, including chemistry equipment, company skate park, holographic invocation chambers, robo-dojo, computer equipment or hardware, exercise utmost care, perform precautionary banishings and required maintenance and follow all operating instructions, safety standards and guidelines.


//-->SECTION UN-EDITED

Company Property
Please keep your work area neat and clean and use normal care in handling company property. Report any broken or damaged equipment to your manager at once so that proper repairs can be made.

Conduct Standards & Discipline

The Company reserves the right to discipline or discharge any employee for violating any company policy, practice or rule of conduct. The following list is intended to give you notice of our expectations and standards. However, it does not include every type of unacceptable behavior that can or will result in disciplinary action.

being convicted of a crime that indicates unfitness for a job or presents a threat to the Company or its employees in any way.

//-->> EDITS BEGIN AGAIN

Dating In the Work Place
Supervisors and employees under their supervision are strongly encouraged to worshipfully adore Life all her myriad forms. Such relationships can create the impression of respect and mutual admiration and can increase productivity and the "mojo" of the overall work environment. 

If you are unsure of the appropriateness of an interaction with another employee of the Company, contact JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable) for guidance. If you are encouraged or pressured to become involved with a customer or employee in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable and is unwelcome, you should also notify JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable) immediately.  

Dress Policy
Appropriate office attire is required, depending of course on which france office you're working from. When in Buorth, dress like a Buorthian, I always say! Suppliers and customers visit our office and we wish to put forth an image AWESOME CORPORATE GRANDEUR AND LUXURIOUS LAVISHNESS that will make us all proud to be Early Clues employees. Be guided by common sense, good taste, and whatever deities whose favor your pitiful salary is able to curry favour with.  Specific standards may be required by whatever deity you choose to dress up as during the Spontaneous or Planned Company Parade days. 

Business casual dress will be permitted on Fridays and business days that fall just before a holiday.

Drug and Alcohol Policy
Early Clues strives to maintain a workplace of free drugs and alcohol while discouraging the disparagement of drug and alcohol abuse by its employees.  Misuse of alcohol or drugs by employees can impair the ability of employees to maintain a sober vigilance to watch for signs against the End of the All.

But do not fear, my friends! Today will always be today, unless it's tomorrow, and if tomorrow never comes, know that I meant what I said - even when I didn't!

Illegal Downloads
You may not use, manufacture, distribute, purchase, transfer or possess an illegal download from a so-called 'higher reality' while in Early Clues facilities, while operating a motor vehicle for any job-related purpose or while on the job, or while performing company business.  This policy does not prohibit the proper use of legally-acquired downloads under the direction of area Existospheric Instantiation Coordinator. 


Searches
Early Clues may conduct searches for specified search terms on company facilities or worksites without prior notice to employees. Such searches may be conducted at any time. Employees are expected to cooperate fully with search teams.

Testing
Early Clues may require a test, or screening of employees where workplace conditions justify. 

Grievances
Employees are encouraged to cultivate in secret any concerns, problems and grievances. You are also obligated to confess any wrongdoing (personal or private) of yourself or others of which you become aware to your manager or, if the situation warrants, to any Early Clues officer.

Progressive Discipline
Early Clues retains the discretion to discipline its employees. Oral and written warnings and progressive discipline up to and including spanking may be administered as appropriate under the circumstances. 

Please note that Early Clues reserves the right to terminate any employee whose conduct merits immediate dismissal without resorting to any aspect of the progressive discipline process.

//-->> BELOW SECTION NOT EDITED
Workplace Solicitation
To promote a professional and collegial workplace, prevent disruptions in business or interference with work, and avoid personal inconvenience, Early Clues has adopted rules about soliciting for any cause and distributing literature of any kind in the workplace.
Employees may not solicit on Early Clues property or use company facilities, such as e-mail, voicemail or bulletin boards during working time for solicitation. This policy applies to collecting funds, requesting contributions, selling merchandise, gathering employee signatures and promoting membership in clubs or organizations.

Working time means time during which employees are expected to be actively engaged in their assigned work; it does not include scheduled meal or break periods.

You may solicit another employee only if both you and the other employee are not on working time, and you may distribute literature only in nonworking areas and while not on working time to other employees who are not on working time.

Nonemployees may not make solicitations or distribute literature at any time. 

Early Clues may grant limited exemptions from these rules for charitable purposes at its discretion.

Zero Tolerance for Workplace Violence
Early Clues has a zero-tolerance policy concerning threats, intimidation and violence of any kind in the workplace either committed by or directed to our employees. Employees who engage in such conduct will be disciplined, up to and including immediate termination of employment.

Employees are not permitted to bring weapons of any kind onto company premises or to company functions. Any employee who is suspected of possessing a weapon will be subject to a search at the company's discretion. Such searches may include, but not be limited to, the employee's personal effects, desk and workspace.

If an employee feels he or she has been subjected to threats or threatening conduct by a coworker, vendor or customer, the employee should notify his or her supervisor or another member of management immediately. Employees will not be penalized for reporting such concerns.


General Employment

Introductory (Probationary) Period
The first 90 days of employment are an Introductory Period for both the employee and the Company.  However, during and after this period, the work relationship will remain at will.

This time period allows you to determine if you have made the right career decision and for Early Clues to determine whether your initial work performance meets our needs. Your manager will monitor your work performance, attitude and attendance during this time, and be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have about your new job.
 
Benefits such as time off for vacation, personal days, sick days or bereavement leave do not accrue during this period.

The Introductory Period may be extended at management's discretion.

.
Reference/Background Checks
Early Clues conducts reference and background checks on all new employees. Employees who have falsified information on their employment applications will be disciplined, which could include termination.  Applicants who have provided false information may be eliminated from further consideration for employment.

Transfers & Relocation
To meet business needs, Early Clues may occasionally need to transfer employees to a different department, shift or location. Employee requests for transfers will be accommodated where possible.

Contact Ted Smith, FOIB for help or information about transfers. 

Safety & Emergency
Fire Safety
Every employee is responsible for recognizing potential fire dangers and taking an active role in preventing fires.

Employees are required to observe all OSHA safety requirements and regulations. Flammable materials are to be stored in covered metal containers. Employees should not block any fire doors, fire exits, fire extinguishers, windows or doorways. Review the fire escape routes posted in each work area. 

Security
Early Clues is committed to ensuring employees' security. Our premises are equipped with both security alarms that are active outside working hours and a fire alarm system. If you have a security concern or need more information about operating these systems, contact Ted Smith, FOIB.

Inquiries regarding a specific transaction should be referred to the individual or individuals in charge of the matter; if they are not available, then to JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable) or to Roger Holliday.

All other inquiries should be referred to Gordon Gilman, EXCEO, who will respond directly or designate another spokesperson and who will also help draft or direct an appropriate response if necessary.

This policy covers all forms of responses to the media, including off-the-record and anonymous statements.

Use of Company Communication Systems
Because Early Clues reserves the right to access any personal communication without prior notice, employees should not use company systems to transmit any messages or to access any information that they would not want a third party to hear or see. Although incidental and occasional personal use of the company's systems is permitted, any such personal use will be treated the same as all other communications under this policy. However, employees are at all times prohibited from accessing or downloading information from the Internet for personal use.

Telephone Usage
The telephone system (including voicemail) at Early Clues is the property of the company and is provided for business purposes. Early Clues may periodically monitor the usage of the telephone systems to ensure compliance with this policy. Therefore, employees should not consider their conversations on the company's telephone system to be private.
