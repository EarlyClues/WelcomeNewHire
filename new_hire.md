# WELCOME NEW HIRE 

## You're officially awesome!

**Dear Employee:**

You and Early Clues have made an uber-important decision: the corporate bond of marriage. And that means foreverâ€¦
 
You must be so excited to begin your career at Early Clues!

Good, cultivate that feeling.

Because our plan is to rigorously harvest employee enthusiasm, and transform it into BIG SAVINGS!!! which we can then pass on to our dear, dear, valued clientele, and money launderers overseas. In fact, you might say it's our business model! 

## Congratulations On Your Selection!

If you've made it this far, it's because you've passed a rigorous 63.5-point background and permanent record/user history check, as required by *Universal Free Realms Standard Protocols regarding Worker Repurposing*. Investigation results are now available for private review in your Liminal Vault. After a 21 day probationary period, they will be released publicly in the interest of transparency on our multi-dimensional internet locality.

The Company has tentatively decided (a position we are free to revoke without notice or hesitation) that you can potentially contribute to our success, and you've decided that Early Clues is the organization where you can update your social media at a leisurely pace. As part of the hiring process, we begged you to reconsider this working arrangement, but now we are all equally stuck. Legally and permanentinuously. So let's make the most of it, shall we? 

However, we believe we've each made the right decision, one that will result in a profitable relationship if we all just "stick with it." The minute you start working here, you become an integral part of Early Clues and its future. 

## Onboarding Particulars

As an integral part of our SATISFACTION PIPELINE PROCESS, it will be integral that you integrate fully your goals, desires and fantasies into our current corporate integration. Because, as we like to say around the office: _we're all in this together, sport!_

Every job in our company is occasionally important, and you will play a key role in the continued growths on our company, or you will be cast aside like so much useless junk. 

In fact, it is hereby obligatory that you immediately update your Worldview.Pack() so that the importance, grandeur and even - dare I say it -  **majesty** of our corporation occupies a position of undisputed centrality in your experiential landscape. You could call us "the Mountain of your Being," if you want, because that is what we've already become - and which you will spend every day hereafter climbing, climbing, climbing to actualize this hidden reality on our patented company ladders and climbing walls (availability varies by branch location). With acceptance and installation of this simple critical patch, success is sure to follow!

Should you have any questions concerning this handbook, your employment or the benefits and risks of switching to another company in this market, please feel free to activate your Inner.HelpDesk to discuss them in detail with your supervisor or manager's automated in-world avatar. 

Again, welcome!

## What's Next?

We are pleased to announce that you hereby agree formally, as per binding/non-binding terms in our revised employee agreement that, upon reading this sentence, you will finally and irrevocably revoke all sense of finality heretoafter in perpetuity. 

We thank you for your gracious compliance in this matter. Together, we can broaden our business horizons!

Signed,

*The Hiring Committee*

# COMPANY POLICIES

### Confidentiality Agreement

Information that pertains to Early Clues's business, including all nonpublic information concerning the Company, its vendors and suppliers, & branar co-habitants is strictly confidential and must neither be given nor fore-taken by entities who are not employed by Early Clues.

Please help protect confidential & liminal information - which may include, for example, _trade secrets, customer lists and company financial information_ - by taking the following precautionary measures:

- Wear a disguise at all times
- Discuss work matters only with other Early Clues employees who have a specific business reason to know or have access to such information and who are themselves wearing a disguise.
- Do not discuss work matters in public places. Do not discuss work matters in private places. 
- Monitor and supervise visitors to Early Clues to insure that they enjoy their visit.
- Destroy hard copies of documents containing confidential information as may be required to maintain one's own emotional integrity.
- Secure confidential information in desk drawers and undergarments at the end of every business day.

Your cooperation is particularly important because of our obligation to protect the security of our clients' and our own confidential information.  Use your own sound judgment and good common sense, but not too much or too often. If at any time you are uncertain as to whether you can properly divulge information or answer questions posed by your Inner.HelpDesk or its agents, please consult an Early Clues officer.

### Conflict of Interest

Employees must avoid any personal interests or relationship which might conflict with one another or which might appear to conflict with the best interests of Early Clues. The reason being is that "we" are much more "interesting" than "you." The things "you" do or say as an individual can and will be utilized by our marketing department to make "us" look interesting,  your interests (be they badminton, or whatever) will be tolerated in so far as they further our own. You must avoid any situation in which your loyalty may be divided and promptly disclose any situation where an actual or potential conflict may exist.  

*Examples of potential conflict situations include:*

- Having a personal interest in games, books, or food, for example
- Displaying behaviours scientifically-proven to be indicative of self-interest, such as but not limited to personal grooming, attempted use of sick-days, etc
- Owning or having a significant financial interest in, or other relationship with, a Early Clues competitor, customer or supplier, and
- Accepting gifts, entertainment, healings or other benefit of more than a nominal value from a magician, herald, wizard, or parade-side peddlar. 

Anyone with a conflict of interest must disclose it to management and remove themselves from negotiations, deliberations or votes involving the conflict and pray in a closed cell for 17 days and nights, or a Full Buorthian Moon - whichever comes first. You may be called upon after your period of mandatory seclusion to answer questions about the Nature or Essence of Being such that your knowledge may be of assistance to Early Clues and its ontological shareholders and stakeholders. 

### Coupon Use In Carnivals

A coupon can be used only when presented and given by a badged associate. The carnivals will no longer carry the free goldfish or the prank chewing gum finger snappers because of abuse recently located as to having happened almost 30 years ago. This rule must be followed if continued employment at Early Clues is your goal. In other words, no messing around!

### Television Use

We cannot as a forthright corporation resort to this barbarian use of televised pleasantries once aired and stored in the decades that came before our leading edge approach on without addressing it. The use of "Televisions" is hereby banned and will be enforced by security squadrons until the next update of security updates. 

Please stay on your data modules until we sound the emergency horn. In which case it will be now safe to renew your cable PACKAGES. Please wait for the horn before doing so. If you're wondering where the emergency horn is. Rest assured, it is still outside. Until it's not.

Please do tune in as it will be televised to keep new hires up to speed on a network yet to be announced!

## Anti Discrimination & Harassment

### Employee Parity Policy

Early Clues provides equal opportunity and employment parity in all of our employment practices to all qualified entities and applicants without regard to entity characteristics or bio-technical expressions of same, not limited to: color, gender, girth, ontological origin, age, mana points, disability, marital status, military status, relationship (or lack thereof) to a Mall Fountain or any other applicable or non-explicable category protected by Universal Free Realms Standard Protocols. This policy applies to all aspects of the employment relationship, including recruitment, hiring, compensation, promotion, transfer, disciplinary action, layoff, return from layoff, re-return to re-layoff, un-offing and re-unoffing, plus all training, aid and social, parade-related and recreational programs. All such employment decisions will be made without unlawfully discriminating on any unprohibited basis. 

### Policy Prohibiting Harassment and Discrimination

Early Clues strives to maintain an environment free from calamity, discrimination and harassment, where employees both trick and treat each other with respect, dignity and courtesy, and where each entity present or not present is equally encouraged and enabled to express the full glory of their innermost being in a community of actualized entities sharing the same bandwidth of experience. 

This policy applies to all phases of the moon, including but not limited to waxing, waning, full, dark, crescent, etc.

### Prohibited Behavior

Early Clues does not and will not tolerate any type of spitting or kicking on company grounds, unless it is spitting out the taste of a deal gone sour, or the kicking of a company-endorsed hacker-sack or "football bag" as the kids call it. 

Harassment of our employees is a right reserved exclusively to our customers, and their customers and their customer's customers. But after that, the "buck stops here," so to speak. 

Discriminatory conduct or conduct characterized as exclusionary as defined below is prohibited.

- Choosing one thing over another
- Including one thing to the exclusion of another
- Similar acts

### Break Policy

All employees that are able and willing to break-dance will be granted ONE (1) extra window of break time. We encourage exercise and encourage fun especially if it is done with the style Early Clues likes to see (see Early Clues' Style Handbook for more details on this). However, break dancing is a trademarked feature of our business and must not be shared outside of the break room. Stiff penalties will be assessed and potential termination may be applied for breaking these rules. 

While we regret requiring this level of security, we would like to see the dancing kept strictly to the designated break rooms. A pamphlet that contains the campus map can be found in all lobbies in which you can find your nearest break room.

### Complaint Procedure and Investigation

Any employee who wishes to report a possible incident of ontological harassment, unwelcome reality "spamming" or other unlawful harassment or discrimination (as described above) should promptly report the matter to JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable). If that person is not available, or you believe it would be inappropriate to contact that person, contact Roger Holliday or Richard Rider (or Steve.E in his absence). Or leave a note with the janitor if noone else is around. 

Early Clues will conduct a prompt investigation as obnoxiously as possible under the circumstances. Employees who raise concerns and make reports in good faith can pray to their heathen gods to contain the trembling of their knees for the fear of our swift and certain reprisal; at the same time employees have an obligation to cooperate with Early Clues in enforcing this policy and all policies of Early Clues in not just their own lives and hearts, but upon the population at large.

Anyone found to have engaged in any such wrongful or inglorious behavior will be subject to appropriate discipline, which may include termination or encasing in a restrictive mineral layer to restrict further modulation of form in time-space. 

### Training

Early Clues will establish proper training for all employees concerning their rights to be free and steps they can take to ensure their freedom from the Empire for years to come. 

### Employment at Will

Unless expressly proscribed by statute or contract, your employment is to be considered "at will," or "Love under Law" in applicable jurisdictions. All Early Clues employees are subject to the Law of Heaven without advance notice. Employees are also free to quit at any time, but they are still bound by the rules contained in this agreement. Any employment relationship other than the binding/non-binding one set out in this document must be set out in script writ upon stone tablets and signed by Early Clues's Gordon Gilman, EXCEO.

## TERMINATION POLICY

All employees will be terminated for TWO (2) days near the end of all Decembers. The Holiday Party is when we will welcome all terminated employees back into the fold of our normal day to day business. We want each employee to fear this time of year because we feel through the studies embarked upon by our marketing and psychology departments that ZANTA1000 is a true asset, while you are not! We will be doing favors all throughout the Post Termination Process (PTP). During this time the employee can expect depression, excitement and a greater appreciation for our next year of business, outreach and repeating the same processes that make Early Clues the industry leader in what our charter and growth algorithms dictate.

### Amendment to Termination Policy

"Employee handbook rules" still apply even after official "termination" and institute forthwith a requirement that terminated entities wait breathlessly by the phone on the off-chance that we will call them back to reconcile for a period not to exceed 13 aerth years.

If we find out that terminated entities have been faithless in our absence, our ire will aroused, greatly aroused.

## Compensation & Work Schedule

### Attendance & Punctuality

Every employee is expected to attend work regularly and report to work on time, unless that doesn't "jive" with them, in which case, "don't sweat it."

If you are unable to report to work on time for any reason, telephone your supervisor as far in advance as possible. If possible, send an OpenQNL messenger-avatar. If you cannot afford one in meatspace, a suitable replacement may be offered as a sacrifice by the Company on your behalf, but it's price will be taken out of your wages (except where occurring during designated holiday times). If you do not call in an absence in advance of said _in absentia_, it will be considered unexcused and all non-excuses will be temporarily excused.

## Bonus Compensation

You may become eligible for a periodic bonus. But probably not. We will certainly do our best to keep you informed of our incentives program. (Employee Incentive Program documentation is always posted by company toilets.)

## Flexible Work Hours & Telecommuting

The Company has established a flexible work arrangement program for employees whose departments and jobs are suited to it: including but not limited to entities whose primary residence is on another plane of being, a parallel or orthogonal dimension, or a branespace unlike our own whose form factor - if instantiated in our realm - would cause undue rupture to the local Existosphere. 

With a manager's approval, you may be allowed to begin and end your workday earlier or later than established hours or to arrange to telecommute or teleport back to your charging station for a brief rest period. To maintain a flexible work arrangement, employees must ensure business needs are met before their own will be considered and must adhere to attendance and punctuality policies, as outlined in this document and on the many post-it notes taped above the company sink in the company break room.  

If you wish to set up a flexible work arrangement as described above, see Ted Smith, FOIB.  Best to bring him some kind of offering: _he has a sweet tooth, I hear!_ Such arrangements may be established, changed or discontinued at the Company's sole excretion.

### Scripture Policy

As any new hire _may attesteth_, our offices are ostentatiously adorned with scripture laden ornaments. This is the method in which Early Clues strives to create and maintain a fun, but efficient environment in which our business can continue to thrive. It is necessary that all new hires memorize these scriptures as the test will come at some point in the summer as to new hires' adherence to our chief principles. The test will not be announced. Stay aware at all times of the scriptures in the same way one might note the fallout shelter placards near the piano room.

###Dietary Restrictions

As a confirmed member of our corporate community, it is vitally important that you begin immediately to follow a few easy dietary restrictions. 

_Due to the unique nature of our work, as well as the extreme multi-branar sensitivities of some of our diverse clientele, it is hereby obligatory that you (on or off duty):_

- Refrain from eating anything potentially considered "offensive" or otherwise "gross" from the viewpoint of our clients. This does not just apply to clients in your particular "casebook", but to all of our clients as a corporate body. For we are all one, contiguous with one another's experiential fields. 
- Always say _please_ and _thank you_, wait until everyone is seated and earnestly wish everyone a _good meal_ before beginning eating.


## Outside Employment

Before beginning or continuing outside employment, think to yourself: what is it that am I really "outside" of or inside of? It's a question we like to ask ourselves when stuck on a complex problem. 

**Checklist:**

- Are you working outdoors? 

If not, then you probably do not qualify for "Outside Employment" Insurance. [See section 21.b of Definitions.Manual:357.006 "_What is outside and inside_?]

### Questionnaire Policy

Employees are required to complete a questionnaire to obtain the written approval of their managers and Ted Smith, FOIB. 

Failing to obtain approval may be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of snack machine privileges. We understand if this may sound harsh, but trust us that it is for all of our benefit.

## Ownership Policy

As you were ritually informed during our initial hiring ceremony, Early Clues is a **public domain corporation**. 

This means, in effect, that everyone owns what we do - including you (unless you have revoked your membership in "The Public" at-large, as some of our staff have done).

In fact, as soon as we do something (literally anything), we wrap it up into a big gift ball and kickstart it directly into the Public Domain. We believe that this not only encourages a spirit of openness, innovation, givingitude and community endeavour, but that it more importantly helps spread the blame when things go wrong.

_"It's everyone's fault"_ - you might hear that old chestnut passed around the office. And it's true, up until a point.

What we really mean when we say that, is that it's actually specifically *your fault* - especially for the new hires. We demand nothing less than your full excellence and continual selfless sacrifice. This means, in practical terms, that you're expected at all times to take full "ownership" of not just your own mistakes and errors in judgement, but those of upper management as well, up to the point of termination or imprisonment by secular authorities.

### Transparency Policy

In the interest of total transparency for our customers, we have a policy of printing all company-related materials strictly on plastic transparencies, which are then projected onto whatever available cloud layer which HARPA administrators have allocated for the designated time-slot. Twarted transmissions must be no longer than 128 characters.

## Performance Evaluations

Supervisors and employees are strongly prohibited from discussing work with one another. We like to keep a congenial "relaxed" work atmosphere, so we try not to bother one another with "boring" words like "expectations" or "performance."

Formal performance reviews will instead be conducted covertly at all times by our secret partners to provide both supervisors and employees with the opportunity to discuss the litany of your past failures in a fun casual atmosphere over Chuck E. Cheese pizza. These formal reviews will be conducted before the eyes of our animatronic overlords as they sing and dance for our amusement. We pray to them for your forgiveness.

### Performance Reviews and Salary Increases

Wage reviews are conducted every 30 seconds for each employee, and salary increases are based on those reviews, as well as our profitability - and are never granted.  However, an employee receiving a negative performance appraisal will have their user account suspended for the next 30 second performance evaluation cycle. Best to make it count, as two consecutive "time-out" periods will revoke your probationary status and any rights inferred to you by this agreement. And the third such failure will result in a retro-active termination.

## Conduct Standards

### Company Equipment and Vehicles

When using Early Clues property, including chemistry equipment, company skate park, holographic invocation chambers, robo-dojo, experimental goose park, computer equipment or hardware, please arrange to exercise utmost care, perform precautionary banishings and required maintenance and follow all applicable OpenQNL operating instructions, safety standards and guidelines.

### Company Property
Please keep your work area neat and clean and use normal care in handling normal company property normally. Report any broken or damaged equipment to your manager at once so that proper repairs can be made at the expense of the employee who reported the damage.

You may not use any company or private property for personal purposes or remove any company property from the premises without prior written permission from JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable).

### Conduct Standards & Discipline

Early Clues expects every employee to adhere to the highest beliefs.  

The Company reserves the right to discipline or discharge any employee for violating any company policy, or just for fun. The following list is intended to give you notice of our expectations and standards. However, it does not include every type of unacceptable behavior that can or will result in disciplinary action, as they are many and evolving. Be aware too that Early Clues retains the discretion to determine the nature and extent of any discipline based upon the circumstances of each individual case.  

_Employees may be disciplined or terminated for poor job performance, including, but not limited to the following:_

- Depression, malaise, distraction
- Repeated excuses
- Failing to "buck up"

_Employees may also be disciplined or terminated for misconduct, including, but not limited to the following:_

- Falsifying twice-daily happiness reports
- Failing to record illegal thoughts and report them to the proper authorities
- Insubordination or other refusal to perform at minstrel parties
- Disorderly conduct, fighting or other acts of violence
- Violating conflict of interest rules
- Presenting a threat to the Company or its employees in any way

## Dating In the Work Place

Supervisors and employees under their supervision are strongly encouraged to worshipfully adore Life all her myriad forms. Such relationships can create the impression of respect and mutual admiration in the workplace and ripple outwards to the entire world and can increase productivity and the "mojo" of the overall work environment. 

If you are unsure of the appropriateness of an interaction with another employee of the Company, contact JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable) for guidance. If you are encouraged or pressured to become involved with a customer, employee or other entity in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable and is unwelcome, you should also notify JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable) immediately.  

And when in doubt, Quantum-Jump Out!

### Dress Policy

Appropriate office attire is required, depending of course on which branch office you're working from. (Clone style of branch.manager and watch for updates)

Textile suppliers and costumers visit our office and we wish to put forth an image of AWESOME CORPORATE GRANDEUR AND LUXURIOUS LAVISHNESS that will make us all proud to be Early Clues employees. Be guided by common sense, good taste, and whatever deities whose favor your pitiful salary is able to curry favour with.  Specific standards may be required by whatever deity you choose to dress up as during the frequent spontaneous or planned Company Parade days and we expect you to obey them. 

Business casual dress will be permitted on Fridays and business days that fall just before a holiday.

## Drug and Alcohol Policy

Early Clues strives to maintain a workplace of free drugs and alcohol while discouraging the disparagement of drug and alcohol abuse by its employees.  Misuse of alcohol or drugs by employees can impair the ability of employees to maintain a sober vigilance to watch for signs against the End of the All.

### Internet Use Policy 

You may not use, manufacture, distribute, purchase, transfer or possess an illegal download or stored binary or other value from a so-called 'higher reality' while in Early Clues facilities, while operating a motor vehicle for any job-related purpose or while on the job, or while performing company business.  This policy does not prohibit the proper use of legally-acquired variants of same utilized under the direction of area Existospheric Instantiation Coordinator. 

### Searches
Early Clues employees may conduct searches for specified search terms on company facilities or worksites without prior notice to The Company. Such searches may be conducted at any time. Employees are expected to cooperate fully with search terms, as they would like to have them.

## Grievances

Employees are encouraged to cultivate in secret any concerns, problems and grievances and carefully encrypt them in their Liminal Vault. You are also obligated to confess any wrongdoing (personal or private) of yourself or others of which you become aware to your manager or, if the situation warrants, to any Early Clues officer, who will be authorized to prescribe prayers or ritual tasks in amelioration of said deleterious condition. 

### Progressive Discipline
Early Clues retains the discretion to discipline its employees. But mostly, we like it when employees discipline themselves at their own discretion. Oral and written warnings and progressive discipline up to and including spanking may be administered by employees on self as appropriate under the circumstances. 

Please note that Early Clues reserves the right to terminate any employee whose conduct merits immediate dismissal without resorting to any aspect of the progressive discipline process.


## Workplace Solicitation

To promote a professional workplace, prevent disruptions in business or interference with work, and avoid personal inconvenience. Early Clues has adopted rules about soliciting for any cause and distributing literature of any kind in the workplace. We are solidly for it. We believe it proves your moxy as a salesperson committed to this company, and we believe in the efficacy of the "marketplace" of ideas, which is why we promote both employee and customer feedback on our "retro" scribble walls located within urinals and bathroom stalls on company facilities. Please leave your message there with the date inscribed, and we will get back to you ASAP!

### Working Time

Working time means time during which employees are expected to be actively engaged in their assigned work; it does not include scheduled meal or break periods, or carnival weekends leading up to a regularly scheduled Grand Parade.

### Charitable Exemptions 

Early Clues may grant limited exemptions from these rules for charitable purposes at its discretion.

### Zero Tolerance for Workplace Violence

Early Clues has a zero-tolerance policy concerning threats, intimidation and violence of any kind in the workplace either committed by or directed to our employees - unless it happens "in game" or during sanctioned in-office game-play. Employees who engage in such conduct outside of scheduled play times will be disciplined, up to and including immediate termination of video game access privileges.

Employees are not permitted to bring weapons of any kind onto company premises or to company functions, unless they are weapons of wit, but they must still be blunted to the point of not offending anyone in particular or any particular viewpoint. Keep it fun! (Unless it's a Roast: See Roast Handbook for details)


## General Employment

### Introductory (Probationary) Period
The first 90 days of employment are an Introductory Period for both the employee and the Company. This means you must salute and introduce yourself to any non-probationary badged staff member on sight and perform the Company Song a capella, until such time when badged staff member grants you leave to speak. 

However, during and after this period, the work relationship will remain at will.

This time period allows you to determine if you have made the right career decision and for Early Clues to determine whether your initial work performance meets our needs. Your manager will monitor your work performance, astrological charts, attitude and attendance during this time, and may or may not be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have about your new job. 
 
Benefits such as time off for vacation, personal days, sick days or bereavement leave must not concern you as they do not accrue during this period.

The Introductory Period may be extended at management's discretion.

### Transfers & Relocation
To meet business needs, Early Clues may occasionally need to transfer employees to a different department, shift or off-worldlocation. Employee requests for transfers will be accommodated where possible.

Contact Ted Smith, FOIB for help or information about transfers. 

## Safety & Emergency


### Fire Safety

Every employee is responsible for recognizing potential fire dangers and taking an active role in preventing and fighting fires.

Employees are required to observe all UFR safety requirements and regulations. Flammable materials are to be stored in covered metal containers. Employees should not block any fire doors, fire exits, fire extinguishers, windows or doorways. Review the fire escape and parade routes posted in each work area. 

### Security

Early Clues is committed to ensuring employees' security. Our promises are equipped with both security alarms that are active outside working hours and a fire alarm system. If you have a security concern or need more information about operating these systems, contact Ted Smith, FOIB. 
 
All employees are given identification cards when they join the Company. Wear your ID at all times while on Company business, whether you are on or off Company premises. If you leave Early Clues, you must surrender your ID and any company keys or socks you have been issued.

##Corporate Communications & Technology

### Bulletin Boards

Check the bulletin boards at http://www.earlyclues.com/intranet regularly to obtain important information about company events and policies. Only Early Clues employees should use company bulletin boards. Management must approve all postings. See Ted Smith, FOIB to obtain approval for a bulletin board posting.

### Communication with Press or Media

Media inquiries in relation to Early Clues or its spiritual advisors must be handled in accordance with the following guidelines:

- Inquiries regarding a specific transaction should be referred to the individual or individuals in charge of the matter; if they are not available, then to JANICE 1.0 or 2.0 (as applicable) or to Roger Holliday.
- All other inquiries should be referred to Gordon Gilman, EXCEO, who will respond directly or designate another spokesperson and who will also designate another spokesperson to help draft or direct an appropriate response if necessary.

_This policy covers all forms of responses to the media, including off-the-record and anonymous statements._

## Use of Company Communication Systems

### Telephone Usage

The telephone system (including voicemail) at Early Clues is the property of the company and is provided for business purposes. Early Clues may periodically monitor the usage of the telephone systems to ensure compliance with this policy. Therefore, employees should not consider their conversations on the company's telephone system to be private.

### Personal Mail

All mail delivered to the company is presumed to be related to company business. Mail sent to you at the company will be opened by the office and routed to your department. If you do not wish to have your correspondence handled in this manner, please have it delivered to your home.

## Vacation & Holidays

### Holidays

_Early Clues observes the following holidays:_

- Ymas
- Qmas
- Umas 
- And the harmonic overtones and cross convergence dates of the above

**You will be paid for these holidays if you:**

- Are a full-time employee who has worked at least 100,000 consecutive days at the Company, and
have worked the full day before and the full day after the holiday, unless time off has been approved in advance as vacation or personal days. 
- Holidays that fall on a weekend will be observed either on a Friday or Monday. To avoid confusion, all holidays will be announced in advance. 
- Due to business needs, some employees may be required to work on company holidays.  Your supervisor or manager will notify you if this may apply to you.
